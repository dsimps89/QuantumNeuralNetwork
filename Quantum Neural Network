This Software Patent License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between [Licensor Name], a company organized and existing under the laws of [Jurisdiction], with its principal place of business at [Licensor Address] ("Licensor"), and [Licensee Name], a company organized and existing under the laws of [Jurisdiction], with its principal place of business at [Licensee Address] ("Licensee").

WHEREAS, Licensor is the owner of certain patented software inventions described in [Patent Name/Number] ("Software Patents");

WHEREAS, Licensee desires to obtain a license to use the Software Patents for its internal business purposes;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

1. Grant of License
   1.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software Patents solely for Licensee's internal business purposes as described in Exhibit A.
   1.2. Licensee shall not sublicense, distribute, lease, sell, or otherwise transfer the rights granted under this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of Licensor.

2. Restrictions
   2.1. Licensee shall not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, or create derivative works based on the Software Patents, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law.
   2.2. Licensee shall not use the Software Patents to develop a competing product or for any purpose other than those expressly permitted under this Agreement.

3. Intellectual Property Rights
   3.1. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to the Software Patents, including any modifications or enhancements made by Licensee, shall remain the exclusive property of Licensor.
   3.2. Licensee shall not remove or alter any copyright, patent, or proprietary notices included in or on the Software Patents.

4. Term and Termination
   4.1. This Agreement shall commence on the effective date and continue until terminated as provided herein.
   4.2. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party.
   4.3. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and licenses granted hereunder shall immediately cease, and Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Software Patents.

5. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
   5.1. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction].
   5.2. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute amicably, either party may initiate legal proceedings in the appropriate courts of [Jurisdiction].

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Software Patent License Agreement as of the Effective Date.
